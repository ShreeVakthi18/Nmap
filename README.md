# Nmap Port Scanning and OS Detection Lab

In this lab, I used Nmap to perform network reconnaissance on my own system.

## Tasks Performed:
- Basic port scanning to identify open and closed ports
- Service version detection using -sV
- OS detection using -O with root privileges

## Observations:
- The host was reachable but all common TCP ports were closed
- No unnecessary services were exposed, indicating a hardened system
- OS detection accuracy was limited due to the absence of open ports

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Network scanning and enumeration
- Understanding of attack surface reduction
- Ethical use of security tools
